# Routing Practice
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with useParams and react-router-dom, I'm passing in parameters into specifically worded route inputs render a component (or part of it). This simulates the experience of jumping to a new page, but in as a React application it is Single Page Application.
